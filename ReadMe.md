# University of Arkansas at Little Rock - IFSC 7370: Data Science and Technologies - Michael Riggs

## About

This is the code repository for the research paper "_Comparative Analysis of Relative Toxicity Levels Across
Skill Brackets in Dota 2_," which is the final project for the spring 2024 semester of IFSC 7370 by Michael Riggs.

## Setup

It's recommended to use a virtual environment with a Python 3.8 interpreter for this project, so as to not clutter
your development machine with python packages. To install the requirements for the scripts, after activating your
virtual environment, simply run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to run all necessary Python packages.
Additionally, it will be necessary to create a local .env file for configuration. The scripts are written with
default values included, however the defaults will be much more restrictive than if you configure a .env file.
